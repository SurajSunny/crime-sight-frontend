# Crime Sight Frontend
Main goal of this project is finding patterns in LAPD dataset(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present).
It is visualised to understand and populate meaningful data inorder to understand statistics of crimes. Complex queries are visualised and displayed in an effiecent manner for user understanding.

We explored the following complex trends and provided graphs for each:

How does the seasonal variation in crime rates, adjusted for population density, evolve in different LAPD Community Police Station Areas over time?

How has the detection rate of drug-related crimes changed in specific districts over time?

What are the peak hours for criminal incidents in specific areas by examining the frequency of occurrences at various times of the day over time?

What are the victim counts grouped together by seasons across different age groups in specific areas over time?

How does the rate of change in weapon types used in crimes fluctuate over time in specific locations?

Used React, Context Providers and chart.js
